# literotica-downloader
Small Python script I made to download stories from Literotica.
Not tested on Windows.
BeautifulSoup4 required.

I might add ISO format dates to the start of each story's folder name, but that would take a lot of work. More info in the Python script's comments.

(I barely know how to use Python and have no idea how to use Git...)
